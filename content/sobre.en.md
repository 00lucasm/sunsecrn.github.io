**SunSec** is an information security community with strong roots in the Northeast of Brazil, particularly in Natal and surrounding regions. Our goal is clear: **to increase knowledge and strengthen information security capabilities in the Northeast**, connecting people, sharing experiences, and driving research in the field.

Our work goes beyond online discussions â€“ we promote concrete actions to develop information security in our region:  

âœ… **Event Participation** â€“ We deliver talks, workshops, and technical content at technology conferences and meetups, spreading knowledge and best practices.  

âœ… **Our Own Events and Meetings** â€“ We organize meetups, CTFs, secDojos, and other initiatives that strengthen participants' skills and encourage the exchange of ideas.  

âœ… **Security Research** â€“ Currently, we are focused on **CVE research**, directly contributing to the global security community by identifying and reporting vulnerabilities in critical software and applications.  

## **Our Mission**  
We aim to **strengthen the Northeast in the field of information security**, empowering more people, encouraging research, and developing an ecosystem of innovation and continuous learning. We believe that collaboration and knowledge are the best weapons to make the digital world more secure.
